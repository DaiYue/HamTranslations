# Nullability and Objective-C

# 可空性与 Objective-C

One of the great things about Swift is that it transparently interoperates with Objective-C code, both existing frameworks written in Objective-C and code in your app. However, in Swift there’s a strong distinction between optional and non-optional references, e.g. NSView vs. NSView?, while Objective-C represents boths of these two types as NSView *. Because the Swift compiler can’t be sure whether a particular NSView * is optional or not, the type is brought into Swift as an implicitly unwrapped optional, NSView!

Swift 的一大优点是它能与 Objective-C 代码混编，在 Swift 工程里既可以用 Objective-C 编写的库，也可以用到 Objective-C 的代码。然而，在 Swift 里可选（optional）的引用与非可选（non-optional）的引用泾渭分明，例如`NSView`相对于`NSView?`，而在 Objective-C 里这两种类型都对应`NSView *`。因为 Swift 的编译器判断不出某个`NSView *`是否可选，因此转换为 Swift 的类型就是隐式解包可选类型`NSView!`。

In previous Xcode releases, some Apple frameworks had been specially audited so that their API would show up with proper Swift optionals. Xcode 6.3 supports this for your own code with a new Objective-C language feature: nullability annotations.

在之前版本的 Xcode 中，有些苹果官方的框架经过了专门的调整，来让 API 正确反映 Swift 的可选类型。为了支持在你自己的代码里也能实现这种功能，Xcode 6.3 推出了一项新的 Objective-C 语言特性：_nullability annotations_ 。

### The Core: __nullable and __nonnull

### 核心：__nullable 与 __nonnull

At the core of this feature we have two new type annotations: __nullable and __nonnull. As you might expect, a __nullable pointer may have a NULL or nil value, while a __nonnull one should not. The compiler will tell you if you try to break the rules.

这项新特性的核心是两个新的类型注解：`__nullable`与`__nonnull`。如你所想，标记了`__nullable`的指针的值有可能为`NULL`或`nil`，而`__nonnull`的指针则不可能。如果违反这些规则，编译器会发出警告。

```
@interface AAPLList : NSObject <NSCoding, NSCopying>
// ...
- (AAPLListItem * __nullable)itemWithName:(NSString * __nonnull)name;
@property (copy, readonly) NSArray * __nonnull allItems;
// ...
@end

// --------------

[self.list itemWithName:nil]; // warning!
```

You can use __nullable and __nonnull almost anywhere you can use the normal C const keyword, though of course they have to apply to a pointer type. However, in the common case there’s a much nicer way to write these annotations: within method declarations you can use the non-underscored forms nullable and nonnull immediately after an open parenthesis, as long as the type is a simple object or block pointer.

几乎所有能用 C 传统的`const`关键字的地方都能用`__nullable`和`__nonnull`，当然只能用在指针类型上。不过，一般情况下有一个更好的方法来使用这两个注解：用在方法声明里时可以不用加下划线，直接写在左括号后面，只需后面的类型是普通对象或 block 的指针。

```
- (nullable AAPLListItem *)itemWithName:(nonnull NSString *)name;
- (NSInteger)indexOfItem:(nonnull AAPLListItem *)item;
```

And for properties, you can use the same non-underscored spelling by moving the annotation into the property attributes list.

对于属性，也可以不用加下划线，写在属性特性列表里即可。

```
@property (copy, nullable) NSString *name;
@property (copy, readonly, nonnull) NSArray *allItems;
```

The non-underscored forms are nicer than the underscored ones, but you’d still need to apply them to every type in your header. To make that job easier and to make your headers clearer, you’ll want to use audited regions.



Audited Regions
To ease adoption of the new annotations, you can mark certain regions of your Objective-C header files as audited for nullability. Within these regions, any simple pointer type will be assumed to be nonnull. This collapses our earlier example down into something much simpler.

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN
@interface AAPLList : NSObject <NSCoding, NSCopying>
// ...
- (nullable AAPLListItem *)itemWithName:(NSString *)name;
- (NSInteger)indexOfItem:(AAPLListItem *)item;

@property (copy, nullable) NSString *name;
@property (copy, readonly) NSArray *allItems;
// ...
@end
NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END

// --------------

self.list.name = nil;   // okay

AAPLListItem *matchingItem = [self.list itemWithName:nil];  // warning!
For safety, there are a few exceptions to this rule:

typedef types don’t usually have an inherent nullability—they can easily be either nullable or non-nullable depending on the context. Therefore, typedef types are not assumed to be nonnull, even within audited regions.
More complex pointer types like id * must be explicitly annotated. For example, to specify a non-nullable pointer to a nullable object reference, use __nullable id * __nonnull.
The particular type NSError ** is so often used to return errors via method parameters that it is always assumed to be a nullable pointer to a nullable NSError reference.
You can read more about this in the Error Handling Programming Guide.

Compatibility
What if your Objective-C framework has existing code written against it? Is it safe to just change your types like this? Yes, it is.

Existing compiled code that uses your framework will continue to work, i.e. the ABI does not change. This also means that existing code will not catch incorrect passing of nil at runtime.
Existing source code that uses your framework may get additional warnings for current uses of unsafe behavior at compile time when you move to the new Swift compiler.
nonnull does not affect optimization. In particular, you can still check parameters marked nonnull to see if they are actually nil at runtime. This may be necessary for backwards-compatibility.
In general, you should look at nullable and nonnull roughly the way you currently use assertions or exceptions: violating the contract is a programmer error. In particular, return values are something you control, so you should never return nil for a non-nullable return type unless it is for backwards-compatibility.

Back to Swift
Now that we’ve added nullability annotations to our Objective-C header, let’s use it from Swift:

Before annotating our Objective-C:

在给 Objective-C 代码加注解之前：

```
class AAPLList : NSObject, NSCoding, NSCopying { 
	// ...
	func itemWithName(name: String!) -> AAPLListItem!
	func indexOfItem(item: AAPLListItem!) -> Int

	@NSCopying var name: String! { get set }
	@NSCopying var allItems: [AnyObject]! { get }
	// ...
}
```

After annotations:

加了注解之后：

```
class AAPLList : NSObject, NSCoding, NSCopying { 
	// ...
	func itemWithName(name: String) -> AAPLListItem?
	func indexOfItem(item: AAPLListItem) -> Int

	@NSCopying var name: String? { get set }
	@NSCopying var allItems: [AnyObject] { get }
	// ...
}
```

The Swift code is now cleaner. It’s a subtle change, but it will make using your framework more pleasant.

Swift 的代码更清晰了。只是一个微小的改变，却能让你的框架更易于使用。

Nullability annotations for C and Objective-C are available starting in Xcode 6.3. For more information, see the Xcode 6.3 Release Notes.

C 和 Objective-C 的可空性注解在 Xcode 6.3 及以后版本可用。查看更多信息，请参考[Xcode 6.3 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=xcode-6.3-beta-release-notes)。
