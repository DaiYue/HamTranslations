Recently we launched a new Swift-based app, which was then prominently featured by Apple. It has seen significant numbers of users. In this article, we'd like to share our experiences, give our general thoughts on the new programming language, and point out some nice things Swift provides that we can use to make our apps more solid.

最近我们新发布了一款[基于 Swift 的 app](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/duolingo-test-center/id929167184?mt=8)，一经推出就得到了苹果的特别推荐。它的用户量颇为可观。在本文中，我们将分享一些经验，提出我们对 Swift 这种新语言的总体看法，并指出 Swift 能让我们开发 app 更顺利的一些良好特性。

This is not a Swift tutorial. This post is intended for developers who don't have too much experience with Swift and are wondering how it holds up in a real-world context. We'll refer to some technical concepts and provide links to existing tutorials and documentation where appropriate.

这并不是一个 Swift 教程。本文的目标读者是没接触过 Swift，想知道它在真实世界中到底表现如何的开发者。我们会涉及到一些技术术语，并适当提供现有教程和文档的链接。

For context, we'll first briefly explain what this new app does and what the main goals were.

为了让读者了解情况，我们首先还是来简单介绍一下这个新 app 的功能以及它的主要目标。

## A New App
## 一个新 app

You might be familiar with our main app, Duolingo, a popular language learning app with over 60 million users (Dec 2014), which Apple chose as App of the Year 2013. If you want to learn a new language, Duolingo is the go-to way to do so on your iPhone or iPad.

你可能对我们的主 app [Duolingo](https://itunes.apple.com/app/duolingo-aprende-idiomas-gratis/id570060128?mt=8) 很熟悉了，它是一款流行的语言学习 app，用户量高达 6000 万（截止到 2014 年 12 月），苹果将它评选为 2013 年度 app。如果你想学习一门新语言，Duolingo 是你在 iPhone 和 iPad 上的不二选择。

In addition, we launched Duolingo Test Center, which allows you to certify your knowledge of a language. This is useful, for example, if you're a foreigner who wants to apply for a new job or enroll at a university in the US or England, as these oftentimes require some official certificate that verifies your fluency. Test Center users receive an adaptive test to ascertain their language level. To prevent cheating, tests are monitored by real people.

此外，我们发布了 [Duolingo Test Center](https://testcenter.duolingo.com/)，它能让你证明自己掌握一门语言的水平。例如，作为一个外国人，你想要申请美国或英国的大学或工作，而这些机构往往要求你提供自己语言熟练度的官方证明，此时 Duolingo Test Center 就会派上用场。Test Center 的用户会收到一份适当的测试来证明他们的语言水平。为了避免作弊，测试在真人监控下进行。

Upon launch, Test Center for iOS was featured by Apple in their "Best New Apps" category in over 50 countries.

在发布之初，iOS 的 [Test Center](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/duolingo-test-center/id929167184?mt=8) 就被苹果在超过 50 个国家中推荐为 "最佳新 app"。

### GOALS
### 目标

From a performance standpoint, Test Center is not a very performance-sensitive app. It presents mostly static content with a few controls. In addition, video is being recorded during tests to prevent cheating, but that's about it. We did not notice any performance issues with Swift, but we also did not have to look.

从性能的角度讲，Test Center 并不是一个对性能要求很高的 app。它展示的主要是静态内容和少数几个控件。另外，测试过程中会录像来避免作弊，但也仅此而已。我们没有发现 Swift 有任何性能问题，不过我们也不需要考虑这方面。

Much more important to us was stability and robustness of the app. Since exams take about 20 minutes and will eventually be paid, crashing during an exam would constitute a pretty bad user experience.1 Furthermore, once a test starts, you have to finish it (i.e. you can't pause it or leave the app; we do this to prevent cheating). Accordingly, we want to keep crashes to a minimum.

对我们来说，远比性能重要的是 app 的稳定性和鲁棒性。一次测试要花约 20 分钟，而且是需要付费的，因此在测试过程中 crash 会带来极糟的用户体验。另外，一旦测试开始了，你就必须完成到底（也就是说，你不能暂停，也不能离开 app；我们这样做是为了防止作弊）。为此，我们必须把 crash 降到最低。

### General Thoughts on Swift

### 对 Swift 的总体看法

When Swift was released, many people looked at the syntax of the language and drew comparisons and conclusions. Some said that now that they "don't have to put up with Objective-C's syntax anymore", they could jump into iOS development. Quite frankly, that seems like the wrong way to look at it. Who cares about syntax (as long as it's somewhat reasonable)? There are much more important aspects to a language, such as allowing you to express your concerns easily, and not encouraging bad behavior.

在 Swift 刚发布的时候，就有很多人对它的语法做出了一些对比和结论。有些人说既然他们现在“不用再忍受 Objective-C 的语法”，他们也可以轻易上手 iOS 开发了。坦白来讲，这不是看问题的正确角度。谁会那么在乎语法（只要它基本合理）呢？对一门语言来说，比语法重要的东西太多了，例如它能否让你便捷地表达出你关心的事，以及不鼓励坏习惯。

Swift can get us further down the path of enlightenment than Objective-C and some other languages might. It seems like a step forward, language-wise. If you follow some of its authors, you can tell that they've borrowed good concepts from different places, including the functional programming world. They also did away with existing (but less-than-ideal) concepts where they saw fit.

Swift 能带我们从 Objective-C 及其他语言那里跨出一大步。从语言角度来讲，这是前进的一步。如果你[关注 Swift 的作者们](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm)，你会发现他们从别的语言，包括函数式编程语言，借来了一些很好的概念。同时，他们适当地废除了一些旧有的（但不够理想的）概念。

Swift was a nice and welcome step forward for us since we were used to programming in Objective-C. If your native language is Haskell (or similar), you might feel like there's still room for improvement. We're excited to see what improvements upcoming versions of the language will bring.

因为我们之前习惯了 Objective-C，所以 Swift 已经是一个很大的进步了；如果你惯用的语言是 Haskell（或类似语言），你可能会觉得 Swift 还有改进的空间。我们期待看到这门语言后续版本带来的更多改进。

## The Good

## 优点

Swift supports some features developers have grown used to in other programming languages, such as custom operators and function overloading. Value types (types with value semantics, such as Swift's structs) can make it easier to reason about code.

Swift 支持一些开发者在其他语言中惯用的特性，如自定义运算符和方法重载。值类型（例如 Swift 的结构体）能让代码更容易理解。

We also really like its stronger, static type system which, with type inference, is pleasant to use. Generics were also notably missing from Objective-C. Finally we can have typesafe collections instead of NSArrays containing hopefully this type of object.

另一个我们很喜欢的点是 Swift 更强大的静态类型系统，再加上类型推断（type inference），非常好用。泛型也是 Objective-C 明显缺失的重要一环。我们终于有了类型安全的集合，不像过去的`NSArray`，只能寄希望于里面的对象都是某某类型。

Let's look at some aspects that we've found really useful in more detail.

下面再来具体看一些我们觉得很有用的优点：

### NO EXCEPTIONS

### 没有异常

So far, Swift does not have exception handling. Whether the Swift authors left them out on purpose when they designed the language, or whether they just didn't have the time, we don't know. Not having them, however, we think is a good idea, as (unchecked) exceptions make code more difficult to reason about (Checked exceptions can make it more explicit where an exception might occur, but they also tend to be cumbersome to use, and Objective-C does not support those anyway).

到目前为止，Swift 都没有异常机制。到底是 Swfit 的作者有意为之，还是他们没时间做了，我们不得而知。不过，我们倒是觉得没有异常机制更好，因为非受检异常让代码更难理解（而受检的异常可以更清楚地表明哪里会抛出异常，不过实际用起来更加笨重，而且 Objective-C 本来也不支持）。

In fact, our seventh most common crash is due to an Apple-provided method throwing an exception (-[AVAssetWriterInputHelper markAsFinished]). That method is neither marked nor documented as throwing exceptions, so we had no idea this could happen until we saw the crash report, at which point our app had already crashed for users.

事实上，我们 app 历史上第七严重的 crash 就是一个 Apple 官方的方法（`-[AVAssetWriterInputHelper markAsFinished]`）抛出的异常导致的。这个方法并没有标注会抛出异常，文档里也没提，所以我们完全没想到会 crash；等我们看到 crash report 时才发现，此时用户已经深受其害了。

Experienced Cocoa developers will note that even though Objective-C provides an exception throwing and handling mechanism, exceptions are typically to be used in exceptional circumstances only, which usually refers to non-recoverable situations (even though there are …counterexamples… to this). In this case, the proper solution is probably not to @catch the exception, but to write better code so that it doesn't get thrown in the first place. One might argue that in this case, the exception is really more like a failing assert. But if that's the only intended usage of the concept, why keep it in a new language that has assert() and fatalError()?

有经验的 Cocoa 开发者会注意到，即使 Objective-C 提供了异常抛出和处理机制，一般来说也是只在出现异常情况、已经不可恢复了，才会使用异常（尽管有一些xxx的例子）。这样来说，正确的解决方法并不是`@catch`异常，而是把代码写得更完善一些，根本就不要抛出异常为好。有人可能会指出，这种异常是当做错误断言来用的。但如果它就这一个用途的话，新的语言里已经有了`assert()`和`fatalError()`，还留着它干什么呢？

In general, we want to avoid possibly forgetting to handle a failure case. Ideally, we want to catch all those problems at compile time, not when our app is out in the field. Exceptions make this hard. So what else can we use in Swift to express failability?

总体上，我们是想要避免忘记错误处理的。最理想的情况是，在编译阶段就能暴露出所有问题，而不要等到 app 投入使用之后才发现。异常机制让这一点变得很难。所以，我们在 Swift 里应该如何描述出错的可能性呢？

### OPTIONAL<T>

### OPTIONAL<T>

One of the concepts Swift relies on quite heavily is that of Optionals (you might know this as the Maybe type coming from Haskell). From Apple's docs:

可选类型（Optionals）是 Swift 非常依赖的的一个概念（如果之前写过 Haskell，可能听说过这个概念）。Apple 的官方文档是这样写的：

The type Optional<T> is an enumeration with two cases, None and Some(T), which are used to represent values that may or may not be present. Any type can be explicitly declared to be (or implicitly converted to) an optional type.

Optional<T> 是一个枚举类型，有两种取值，Some(T) 与 None，分别用来代表有值和空值。任何类型都可以显式声明（或隐式转换）为可选类型。

Swift provides syntactic sugar to make working with optionals nice and easy, such as nil for the None case, special unwrapping syntax, operators, and so forth. Additionally, optional chaining allows for clear and concise code involving multiple dependent optionals to be written.

Swift 提供了一些语法糖，来让使用可选类型方便简单，例如 None 与 nil，特别的解包语法，运算符，等等。另外，可选链也让同时涉及多个相互独立的可选类型时，代码编写起来更清晰、简洁。

So how do we use this? Optionals are a great way to encode the possible absence of a value. You can also use it to express that a function might not return the expected result (if you're not interested exactly as to why).

所以什么地方能用到呢？可选类型很适合用来表示值缺失的情况。你也可以用它来表达一个方法可能不会返回期望中的结果（如果你不感兴趣原因的话）。

Why is this better than setting a pointer to nil in Objective-C? It's better because the compiler enforces (at compile-time) that we're talking about the right kind of type. In other words, a non-optional value in Swift can never be nil. Also, Swift's Optionals are more versatile in that they work on more than just pointer types.

为什么这样就比 Objective-C 的设一个指针为 nil 好呢？这样好是因为编译器会（在编译阶段）保证我们用到的类型到底是不是为空。换句话说，Swift 中不可空的类型永远不可能为 nil。另外，Swift 的可选值不只是指针类型可以用，因此更加灵活。

Here's just one example of where this is useful: In Objective-C, any method that returns a pointer type, such as object initializers (e.g. -init) may legally return nil (e.g. if an object can't be initialized). An obvious example would be + (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)name;. You can't just look at that method's type and be certain that it will never return nil.

这里举一个可选值有用的小例子：在 Objective-C 中，任何返回指针类型的方法，例如对象的构造方法（例如 `-init`）都可以合法地返回 nil（例如对象初始化失败时）。一个很明显的例子是`+ (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)name;`。你无法通过看方法的返回类型来判断它会不会返回 nil。

In Swift, you can be. Apple introduced the concept of failable initializers, which are quite handy to express just this on the type level. In Swift, that same example reads: init?(named name: String) -> UIImage. Note the ?, which expresses that init here might return nil if no resource named name can be found.

但在 Swift 里就可以。Apple 引入了可失败构造方法的概念，在类型层面上体现这一点是非常方便的。在 Swift 中，与上面等价的方法名是`init?(named name: String) -> UIImage`。注意其中的`?`，它表示这个初始化方法可能返回 nil，比如找不到名为`name`的资源时。

We use all of this a lot, where appropriate (we're trying to steer clear of implicitly unwrapped optionals and force-unwrapping). If an expression may yield nil (e.g. through failure) and we don't need to know why, Optionals are a great way to do that.

这些我们都用到了很多，遇到合适的地方（我们尽量避开隐式解包与强制解包）就用。如果一个表达式可能得到 nil（例如发生错误）而我们不需要知道原因，可选类型是个很棒的选择。

### RESULT\<T>

### RESULT\<T>

If you have a call that might fail and you do want to know why if it does, then Result (an Either subtype, for our functional programming friends) is a very simple but incredibly nice type that Swift allows you to define.

如果你要调用一个可能会失败的方法，而一旦失败你想要知道原因，那么可以用 `Result`（对于函数式编程的朋友，它可以理解为`Either`的子类型），这是 Swift 里一个非常简单但极其好用的类型。

Similar to Optionals, Result allows you to express – on the type level – that something might be either a value of a given type, or an NSError.

与可选类型类似，`Result`允许你——在类型层面上——表示一个东西可能是给定类型的值，或者是一个`NSError`。

Like Optional<T>, Result<T> is simply an enum with two cases such as Success(T) and Failure(NSError). The success case carries the value you're interested in as its payload. Unless there was an error, in which case you get a .Failure with a descriptive NSError.

与`Optional<T>`类似，`Result<T>`只是一个简单的枚举类型，有成功（T）和失败（NSError）两种取值。取值为成功时带有你想要的结果，而一旦出错，得到的就是`.Failure`，它带有一个描述失败的`NSError`。

Unlike Optional, Result is not part of the Swift standard library, i.e. you have to define it yourself. (Currently, there's some missing compiler features that you'll have to work around.)

与可选值不同的是，`Result`并不在 Swift 的标准库里，也就是说你必须自己定义这个类型。（目前为止，编译器缺少一些所需的特性，你得想办法绕过去）。

We use Result heavily in our networking, I/O, and parsing code, and it easily beats the old NSError inout pointer pattern, or having completion blocks with both success values and error pointers (or the even more convoluted combination of success boolean and NSError pointer).

我们在网络、I/O 和解析代码部分大量用到了`Result`，它轻松打败了过去传入传出`NSError`指针的模式，或者把成功的值和失败指针传进 completion block（还有更复杂convoluted的，表示是否成功的 boolean 与`NSError`指针的组合）。

Result is elegant and can make your code better, more concise, and safer. In our app, any expression that can (non-fatally) fail returns either an Optional or a Result.

`Result`很优雅，它可以让你的代码更好，更简洁，更安全。在我们的 app 里，任何可能会失败的（只要不是致命的）表达式都返回可选值或者`Result`。

### INTEROPERABILITY WITH OBJECTIVE-C

### 与 Objectiv-C 的兼容性

One of the key design concerns with Swift was Objective-C interoperability. It's just not feasible for Apple to introduce a new programming language and replace their entire stack of libraries with Swift reimplementations – at least not at the same time. Additionally, the development community sits on a massive amount of Objective-C code. Without decent Objective-C interop, Swift probably would have been a non-starter for pragmatic reasons.

Swift 设计时关键的考量之一就是与 Objective-C 的兼容性。让苹果引入一种新的编程语言，并且把所有的库完全用 Swift 重新实现，这不现实（interoperability）——至少同时进行不现实。另外，开发者社区建立在海量的 Objective-C 代码基础上。如果不能兼容 Objective-C， Swift probably would have been a non-starter for pragmatic reasons.

Fortunately, interoperability with Objective-C is quite easy in either direction, and to the small extent we've used it, it's worked well for us. It should be noted, however, that some Swift concepts (such as enums) are not directly available to Objective-C.

幸运的是，Swift 与 Objective-C 混编双向都很简单，并且就我们用到的这一小部分而言，用起来很方便。然而，需要注意的是，有一些 Swift 的概念（例如枚举类型）在 Objective-C 中并不能直接支持。

For example, one component of our app renders PDF assets, which we wrote in Swift. We wanted to also use this module in our main app from Objective-C. Alas, some of the methods used Swift-only features, which meant that those methods were not automatically bridged. To work around that, we simply introduced a wrapper method that could be expressed in Objective-C.2

例如，我们 app 里有一个渲染 PDF 的组件是用 Swift 写的，而我们 Objective-C 的主工程也想用。唉，有一些方法用到了仅 Swift 支持的特性，所以这些方法无法被自动桥接。为了解决这个问题，我们简单地引入一个 Objective-C 可以用的包装方法：

It was easy to lift some of the existing Objective-C components of our main app and use them from Swift. For that, you simply isolate the component from the rest of the app (ideally it already is modular), and then you import it into Swift via a bridging header.

要把主工程已有的 Objective-C 组件取出来，用到 Swift 里，则十分简单。只需把组件从 app 里隔离出来（理想情况下，它已经是个独立模块了），然后通过桥接头文件导入到 Swift 里。

## The Bad
## 缺点

While Swift constitutes a clear improvement over Objective-C, there is still room for enhancements. For example, this newly minted language lacks some of the expressiveness found in other languages with modern type systems. But being a young language, perhaps this will change soon.

尽管 Swift 相比于 Objective-C 有明显的进步，但仍然有提升的空间。例如，这门崭新的语言缺乏其他语言里现代类型系统的表达能力。但作为一门年轻的语言，也许这一点很快就会改善。

Apple pledged to keep your submitted binaries alive, but said that they might change the language as they see fit (in fact, they've already done that a few times). That means that you might have to fix your code after upgrading the compiler, or it might no longer compile. In practice, we knew this would happen and accepted it. Fortunately, we didn't have to spend too much time on "fixing" existing, previously working code so far.

苹果保证会持续支持你提交了的包，但是称他们可能会适当地修改语言（实际上，他们已经这么干过几次了）。这意味着你升级编译器之后可能需要修复一下代码，不然编不过。在实践中，我们知道有这回事，也接受了这个现实。幸运的是，到目前为止我们并没在“修复”已有代码上花太多时间。

Our biggest gripe – and source of frustration – with Swift is probably not the language itself, but the tooling around it. Xcode (Apple's Objective-C and Swift IDE) does not yet feel solid with Swift code. During development of our app, the IDE would often slow down noticeably or crash. There was no (or very slow) code completion most of the time, basically no debugger, unstable and unreliable syntax highlighting, a slow text editor (once the project reached a certain size), and no refactoring tools.

我们最大的抱怨——也是倍感挫折的一点——不在于 Swift 这门语言本身，而在于它的开发工具。用 Xcode（苹果的 Objective-C 与 Swift IDE）写 Swift 感觉并不稳定。在我们 app 的开发过程中，这个 IDE 经常明显变慢或者 crash。大部分时间都没有代码自动补全（或者非常慢），基本上没有调试器，语法高亮不稳定、不可靠，文本编辑器很卡（一旦工程达到一定规模就会如此），并且没有重构工具。

Additionally, compiler errors are often incomprehensible and there are still quite a few compiler bugs and missing features (e.g. type inference sometimes goes awry).

另外，编译错误有时让人难以理解，并且编译器仍然有不少 bug 和特性缺失（例如，类型推断有时会有偏差）。

While Xcode has gotten significantly better since we started, most of those points still hold true today, and somewhat spoil the experience. We're hoping that Apple shifts some of its focus to improving the developer tools.

尽管 Xcode 比起我们刚开始时已经好了很多，但上面提到的问题大部分仍然存在，多少影响了体验。我们希望苹果能把一部分精力转移到改善开发者工具上来。

The Numbers

用数据说话

Apple announced Swift in June 2014 at WWDC. In late July of the same year, we started working on Test Center as our first Swift-only iOS app, which we subsequently launched mid-November. The development leading up to version 1.0 of the app took a bit over three months (one developer; Android and Web versions of the app were already live, so we already had a fully functional backend and designs in place).

苹果是在 2014 年 6 月的 WWDC 上宣布 Swift 这门新语言的。同年7月底，我们开始做我们的第一款纯 Swift app —— Test Center，11 月中旬发布了。也就是说 1.0 版的 app 开发花了 3 个月多一点（只有一个开发者；Android 版与 Web 版之前已经上线了，因此后台和设计图都是现成的）。

As we mentioned before, robustness and stability were important to us, so let's see how we did on that front.

正如我们之前提到的一样，鲁棒性和稳定性对我们非常重要，因此接下来看看这方面吧。

CRASHES

Crash

At the time of writing, Test Center has been live for about two and a half months, and has seen a significant amount of downloads and users (e.g. due to being featured by Apple).

在我写下这段文字之时，Test Center 已经上线两个半月了，下载量和用户量都很可观（比如苹果的推荐就带来了不少量）。

As with any first version, never-seen-before problems surfaced, but fortunately it seems we did not overlook any critical bugs. To date, Test Center has a crash rate of about ~0.2%, which seems decent. 3

大部分的 app 第一版上线都会出现之前从来没见过的问题，Test Center 也未能幸免，不过好在我们没有发生致命的 bug。到目前为止，Test Center 的 crash 率在 0.2% 左右，还是不错的。

Let's look a bit more at the crash groups (crashes that have the same cause): The number one crash group (at ~30% of all crashes) comes from an external Objective-C library. In fact, four of the top five crash groups come from Objective-C land (the fifth being a failing assert, which we leave enabled in production builds).

再来进一步看看 crash 类型（相同原因的 crash 归为一类）：最大的一类 crash（占全体 crash 的 30% 左右）是第三方的 Objective-C 库里发生的。实际上，前 5 大crash类型里有 4 个都是来自 Objective-C 这边的（剩下的那个是我们留在发布包里的一个 assert）。

Also of note, the seventh most common crash comes from the previously mentioned Apple-provided Objective-C function that will sometimes @throw exceptions without being documented as such (-[AVAssetWriterInputHelper markAsFinished]).

同时需要注意的是，第 7 大类 crash 就是之前提到的，苹果官方的 Objective-C 接口（`-[AVAssetWriterInputHelper markAsFinished]`）会抛出 exception，而文档里没有提到这一点。

We attribute this low number of crashes to a solid software architecture and our adherence to sound engineering principles. However, Swift eased the process of building this architecture and following best practices by eliminating entire classes of bugs by design. Correctly using Swift's type system, for example, caught and prevented numerous type errors at compile time during development, rather than ever surfacing in production.4



COMPILER PERFORMANCE

We got asked how the compiler performs with a project of our size. According to sloc, our project currently has 10634 lines of actual code (not counting empty lines, comments, etc).

Nuking Xcode's caches and running time xcodebuild -configuration Release takes about two minutes. A debug build takes about 30 seconds to compile. All measurements were performed on a mid 2013 Retina Macbook Pro. Note though that some of that time is spent compiling xib files, and not just Swift.5

You can certainly tell that some of Xcode's features become slower and slower as your project grows, and we are not the only ones noticing. Iteration time (the time it takes after making a code change, hitting CMD+R, and having your app run in the simulator) is also worse than in Objective-C. A quick test shows that adding a single line brings the wait up to 14 seconds, and this varies greatly depending on what you do. Making a similar change in our Objective-C based app takes about two to three seconds.

Now, obviously this is not a sophisticated compiler benchmark, so take these numbers with a big grain of salt. Hopefully you can at least get an idea of where the performance is currently at, though.

Conclusion
To long-time Objective-C developers – especially those with an interest in modern programming languages – Swift is a very welcome and exciting step forward. At the same time, it can be frustrating at times due to the (current) state of the developer tools.

We have shown that (at least for our type of application) Swift can be used to write stable, robust, and high-volume production apps. Our main app, Duolingo, already uses some Swift code, and we're planning on using it more and more in the future.

So why would you choose Swift? As long as you have up-to-date users (you must target iOS 7 or higher) and patience while developing large projects, Swift offers a fresh, well-structured language to develop with. We’d certainly recommend taking it for a spin, especial ly to understand the programming philosophies that Apple seems to be pushing for.

If you know what you're doing in Objective-C, then the switch to "just using" Swift should be fairly easy and straightforward. You can write apps in pretty much the same way as you would in Objective-C. Where things get interesting is when you adopt some of the more advanced concepts. In particular, there seems to be a trend of embracing a more functional style of programming, and we think that's great.

If you already have an app in Objective-C, you probably don't want to rewrite it from scratch just for the sake of using Swift, but you could consider adding new components in Swift.

If we could go back in time and had to rewrite the app, would we use Swift again? Yes.

You actually get to retake a test for free if there's a legitimate crash during a test. ↩

There may very well be better ways to do this. We did not want to lose the expressiveness of the Swift version of the method, so we opted for a simple wrapper. We might look into how to improve this. ↩

This is the ratio of crashes to downloads. We don't have a good "per app start" metric, and the app has been started more often than it has been downloaded, so that percentage could be even lower. ↩

I have long since been hoping for a better (replacement of) Objective-C and am a big fan of Haskell and static typing, for example. Swift is a step in that direction. ↩

If you asked me what single thing I would like to change about this project, then it's probably dropping Interface Builder. I'm slowly replacing the existing xibs with layout code for a variety of reasons. ↩
